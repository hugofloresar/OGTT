## Math Modeling and Analysis of Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) Data 

This project propose an Ordinary Differential Equations System to model Glucose-Insulin dynamics during the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test. With the numerical Glucose curve, we solve a __Bayesian inverse problem__:

_Given five glucose observations, every thirty minutes, find a set of parameters that describe a patient status_

Details about the Mathematical modeling and the inference can be found in the article:
